# Graph Neural Solver for Combinatorial Optimization

Research-oriented benchmark for **learning-augmented combinatorial optimization** with graph neural networks and exact/heuristic OR baselines.

## Research question

Can a graph neural model learn structural information from exact small-instance solutions and use it to guide a fast combinatorial decoder without sacrificing feasibility, and when does that guidance outperform classical heuristics after accounting for optimality gap, latency and distribution shift?

## Current status

**Phase 3 implemented: multi-seed statistical evaluation + deeper OOD size shift + latency decomposition.**

The repository now includes:

- deterministic Euclidean TSP generation;
- exact Held-Karp oracle;
- nearest-neighbor and 2-opt baselines;
- exact-tour edge supervision;
- permutation-equivariant PyTorch message-passing GNN;
- greedy, beam and multi-start feasible decoding;
- 2-opt post-refinement;
- validation checkpoint selection;
- independent model seeds `0/1/2`;
- instance-level model-seed aggregation;
- frozen test and OOD node-count blocks;
- paired bootstrap 95% confidence intervals;
- exact sign tests and paired win rates;
- inference / decoder / local-search / total latency decomposition;
- unit tests and GitHub Actions CI.

## Problem

The initial benchmark is symmetric Euclidean TSP. The learning model predicts edge utility; a separate combinatorial decoder constructs only Hamiltonian tours. The GNN is therefore guidance, not a replacement for feasibility logic.

## Evaluation protocol

Training uses 8-node exact instances. Validation is used only for checkpoint/model selection. Final evaluation uses disjoint blocks:

- `test`: 8 nodes, seeds `100-103`;
- `ood_10`: 10 nodes, seeds `200-202`;
- `ood_12`: 12 nodes, seeds `300-301`.

The principal learned method is `gnn_beam_2opt`. Its reference is **nearest-neighbor + 2-opt**.

Three independently trained GNN seeds are evaluated on every instance. Their results are averaged **within each instance first**; model seeds are not treated as independent test samples. Paired inference is then performed over instance seeds.

## Statistical reporting

For GNN beam + 2-opt versus nearest-neighbor + 2-opt, Phase 3 reports:

- mean paired optimality-gap difference;
- paired 95% bootstrap confidence interval;
- paired win rate;
- exact two-sided sign-test p-value;
- number of paired instances.

A negative paired gap difference favors the GNN method. Statistical significance alone is not considered sufficient for promotion; latency and feasibility remain part of the decision.

## Latency decomposition

The neural pipeline records separately:

1. GNN edge-score inference;
2. multi-start beam decoding;
3. 2-opt refinement;
4. total end-to-end decision latency.

This prevents local-search time from being hidden inside a generic neural inference number.

## Reproduce

## Research contract

- feasibility must remain 100%;
- exact optimality gaps are used where tractable;
- test/OOD blocks are never used for model selection;
- model-seed replication is not confused with test-sample replication;
- nearest-neighbor + 2-opt is the main classical reference;
- quality gains must be interpreted together with latency;
- negative or null GNN results are retained.

## Next research stage

### Phase 4 — CVRP extension

Reuse the graph-learning stack on capacitated vehicle routing with explicit demand and remaining-vehicle-capacity state, exact/small-instance reference solutions, strong OR heuristics and a feasibility-preserving neural decoder.

## Scope boundary

The TSP benchmark is now complete enough to serve as the controlled methodology layer. Large-scale VRP, learned branching, neural cut selection and scheduling graphs should be separate extensions rather than silent additions to the TSP benchmark.
